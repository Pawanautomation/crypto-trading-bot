Since you're looking for established third-party software for crypto buy/sell suggestions, focusing on LLMs like Claude and ChatGPT might not be the best approach. Here are some alternatives to consider:

**Crypto Trading Signal Providers:**

These services analyze market data, technical indicators, and sometimes fundamental factors to generate buy and sell signals. However, it's important to understand that past performance is not indicative of future results. Here are a few reputable options:

 * **TradingView:** Popular charting platform offering a wide range of technical analysis tools and indicators. Many traders use TradingView to develop their own strategies and some offer their signals as a subscription service. 
 * **Cryptohopper:** Offers both automated trading bots and a "copy trading" feature where you can follow signals from other traders.
 * **Bitsgap:** Similar to Cryptohopper, Bitsgap provides automated trading tools and a "social trading" feature where you can copy signals from other users.

**Trading Bot Platforms:**

These platforms offer pre-built trading bots or allow you to create your own using a visual interface. Many bots can integrate with external signal providers, allowing you to combine your chosen signals with automated execution. Here are some options:

* **3Commas:** As discussed earlier, 3Commas is a popular platform for creating and managing crypto trading bots. It integrates with several exchanges and offers various DCA and bot strategies.
* **Gunbot:** A more advanced platform offering a high degree of customization for building your own bots. You can connect Gunbot with various signal providers.
* **TradeSanta:** Offers a user-friendly interface for creating automated trading bots based on various technical indicators. It also integrates with external signal providers.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Track Record:** Before subscribing to any signal provider, check their track record. Past performance is not a guarantee, but consistent positive results over a long period can be a good indicator.
* **Fees:**  Most signal providers and trading bot platforms charge subscription fees. Consider the cost and compare it to the potential benefits before committing.
* **Risk Management:** Don't blindly follow any signal. Always implement your own risk management strategies (stop-loss, position sizing) and backtest any signals before deploying them with real capital.
* **Diversification:**  Relying solely on signals isn't a good strategy. Consider diversifying your approach by incorporating fundamental analysis and your own research.

**Combining with Your Code:**

While these third-party platforms provide signals, you can still utilize your coding skills to enhance your trading approach. Here are some possibilities:

* **Filter Signals:**  Write code to filter signals based on additional criteria, such as technical indicator confirmation or volatility levels.
* **Backtesting with Additional Data:** Your code can backtest the signals alongside your own technical indicators or data sources to get a more comprehensive picture.
* **Custom Alerts:** Develop custom alerts based on a combination of signals, technical indicators, or your own defined criteria.

**Remember:** 

The crypto market is volatile and inherently risky. Using any combination of tools, including third-party software and your code, doesn't guarantee success. Always exercise caution, do your own research, and manage your risk carefully.
